# Back End Engineering Challenge -- Change

Libera-Bank is building a demonstration for a POS system.  To ensure that cashiers give customers the correct (and optimal) set of change - you will devise an algorithm to compute the change (based on US currency)

- You will create a REST service to:
  - stock the till with coins (PUT & PATCH), either by replacing the till or just adding coins
  - return the value of all coins in the till
  - return the count of each coin in the till
  - given a change amount ( < $1) - compute the optimal (smallest number of coins) needed to fufill the request (given the current coins in the till); if you can't make change note that
  - when you make change, remove those coins from the till
  
  for example: 
  - given 10 dimes and 34 pennies in the till; if the change amount were $0.99 you should offer 9 dimes and 9 pennies
  - given 10 dimes, 3 nickels, and 9 pennies; if the change amount were $0.99 you should offer 9 dimes,  1 nickel, and 4 pennies
  - given 10 dimes; if the change amount were $0.99 you should report that you can't make change

## Requirements:

- Do not include a database (for this iteration store all your data 'in-memory')
- Create tests (either physically or suggest in your README) for any common issues
- Handle errors (in format a business rules)

- develop your solution as a complete package that will be run by the Libera team
  - Include a readme and/or instructions for installing and running
  - Induced instructions on how to run your included test or what those tests are
  - Document any assumptions you made and issues you encountered

## Useful information

- for U.S. coins, assume:
  - quarter = 0.25
  - dime = 0.1
  - nickel = 0.05
  - penny = 0.01 


## Bonus

- add a method to the service to return the values (< $1) for which you can't make change for (as an array) as well as the minimal set of coins you need to continue to make change
